# 🧠 Charitable Donation Choice Parser & Analysis

This repository parses and structures data generated by LLMs simulating charitable donation choices. It extracts user profiles and donation scenarios from raw prompts, making the data suitable for structured analysis and modeling.

## 📌 Overview

This project includes:

- Parsing user persona data from LLM-generated prompts.
- Extracting attributes from two competing donation options (Option A and Option B).
- Combining parsed data into a structured DataFrame.
- Supporting downstream tasks such as preference modeling or causal analysis.

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Generate Personas

Navigate into the corresponding LLM model folder (e.g., `llama3/`) and run:

```bash
python persona.py
````

### 2. Generate Donation Schemes

From the same folder:

```bash
python donation.py
```

### 3. Parse and Structure Data

Make sure the CSV file `donation_choices_llama3.csv` is present. Then run the parsing script:

```bash
python parse_and_structure.py
```

This will output the structured file:

```
structured_donation_choices_llama3_full.csv
```

### 4. Analyze Results

Navigate to the analysis folder:

```bash
cd analysis
```

Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
```
